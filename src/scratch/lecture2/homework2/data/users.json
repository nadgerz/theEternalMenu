Continue cooking until all the water has been absorbed.  When the rice is nearly cooked, remove the lid and place raw (or frozen) broccoli florets on top to steam, then place the lid back on to cook for the remaining time.  Once finished, set aside the rice and broccoli and place the skillet back on the heat.",

When it is nearly cooked (plump and pink), about 3 minutes, then mix the remaining sauce with the arrowroot and water and add it to the skillet.",
