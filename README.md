This will (hopefully) one day be a fully fleshed out recipe & menu creation App. 
There are two basic ideas behind it:

### 1. Improving cooking skills through iteration

There are enough recipe sites/apps out there already. While they let you create , share, and import recipes, a functionality I have sorely missed so far is the ability to create a version history for a specific recipe you've created/imported, to enable you test and tweak a recipe until you've perfected it. In essence, a git for recipes which helps you improve your cooking more efficiently. 

The App will have no social aspect to it, I see it more as a highly personal collection of recipes you love, or are trying to perfect. 

Cook like a programmer! 👩‍🍳 

### 2. Easily generating/maintaining an 'Eternal Menu'

My grandma cooks fantastic meals for the whole family. One day I noticed though, that she only really knows about 20 recipes by heart, ones she doesn't need to look up in a book and that are popular with the family and her.

I am assuming that most people won't want to try out new recipes every week, but instead would want to build up a cook book filled with favourites they know they can cook well. The next step then is to help users create weekly/biweekly menus from their recipe collections. 

#### Factors:

- what season is it and what vegetables are available right now?
- how much time do you have that week?
- which days of the week are you able to/need to cook? 
- is there a food pattern (e.g. fish on Fridays) you'd like to see repeated in your menu?

Applying filters should make the creation of a menu much easier.
